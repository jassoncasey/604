Steve is a network protocol specification language whose purpose
is to reduce the burden of designing, verifying, and testing
network protocols. Steve eliminates a class of network protocol

by experienced engineers. The languages and its semantics are 
defined using the $\lambda$ calculus and dependent type theory.
