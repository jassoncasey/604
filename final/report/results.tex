\section{Results}

We constructed a parser and type checker in Haskell for the Steve Programming Language. The parser is built from the Parsec library. The type checker is unfinished and currently parses only simple function definitions and pdu records. There are more complete versions of the type checker included in {\tt TypeCheck.hs}, but they no longer reflect the current scope of Steve.

\subsection{Usage}
The Steve type checker is still being designed so no driver program exists. However,
there are a handful of working functions in {\tt steve\_impl/Debug.hs} for debugging and testing purposes. To typecheck a file, open an interpreter like ghci and load the files
\begin{center}
 {\tt \small >~ghci Internal Parser Ast TypeCheck2 Debug} 
\end{center}
The type checker is invoked by {\tt typeCheckFile "file\_name"}. The output at present is a dummy type that denotes a successful type check followed by the output of the user-defined type environment $\Sigma$.
