\section{Conclusion}

In this work we contributed a network protocol specification language. The
version of the language presented is focused on describing binary message
formats common in many layer 2-4 networking protocols. The primary contribution
of this work is to extend reasoning about message formats into the host language
so unsafe usage of the message format can be found at compile time. Ultimately,
this allows the elimination of two classes of vulnerabilities from network
protocol implementations.
