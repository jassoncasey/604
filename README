        | statements

statements  : statement
            | statement statements

statement : expression ';'

expression  : term
            | 'let' Id '=' expression
            | '\' Id '.' expression

term  : factor
      | factor '+' term
      | factor '-' term

factor   : application
         | application '*' factor
         | application '/' factor

application : primary
            | primary application

primary  : Id
         | Digit
         | '(' compound ')' 

compound : expression
         | expression ';' complex

Status
------
Parser.hs does not support compound expressions.
Prser.hs does not reduce list sizes for errored parses
which results in some catestrophic executions. Should be
a few more hours to resolve.
